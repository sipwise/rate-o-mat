      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is a good idea. If a call is paid for by existing positive cash_balance, then the cost to the subscriber is zero. Customers might use sum(customer_call_cost) or the balance\u0027s cash_balance_interval to determine how much to charge postpaid subscribers - they would end up overcharging them. With this change, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way left to determine how much to charge postpaid subscribers.",
